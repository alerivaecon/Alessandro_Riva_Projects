# **A simple Cake-Eating problem**
The following code provides the solution to a simple Cake-Eating problem I developed out of interest after I learned about the 
basics of Dynamic Programming in my Mathematical Economics class. 

In a Cake-Eating setting, an agent has to consume a finite amount of resource (the "cake") in 
a discrete time setting in order to maximize their total discounted utility. 

In this specific problem,
